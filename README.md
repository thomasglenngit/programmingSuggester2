#### By _**Thomas Glenn**_

## Description

Entering the field of technology can be daunting. It's hard to know where to start. By asking just a few simple questions and the user's contact information, this program can help point the user in the right direction. 

The user is asked to provide their name and contact information, as well as their preferred working location, entering salary, and work hours. After they press 'submit' on the form, the program gives them the best computer language based on their input.



## Setup/Installation Requirements


* Clone document from the following url: https://github.com/thomasglenngit/programmingSuggester2
* Open document from desktop
* Double click, or right click on file called "index.html" to open in your web browser.
* Enter user information and make selections from the drop-down menus. 
* Click "submit" button to see the result!


## Known Bugs

1. The columns style should be the same for each. However, columns five and six must be custom measured because the form inputs are fussy. I'd like to find out how to better adjust them.
