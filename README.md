#### By _**Thomas Glenn**_

## Description

Entering the field of technology can be daunting. It's hard to know where to start. By asking just a few simple questions and the user's contact information, this program can help point the user in the right direction. 

The user is asked to provide their name and contact information, as well as their preferred working location, entering salary, and work hours. After they press 'submit' on the form, the program gives them the best computer language based on their input.

## Known Bugs

There are known bugs in this program! Hooray! The first of which is that it doesn't really work. I mean, it used to work at one point, but doesn't anymore. 

This program will return user information back to the user in a preformatted message. But, it will no longer return the necessary computer language to the user. 

This has been very frustrating. I am open to any suggestions and outside help to correct this bug. I am also currently in therapy to manage my emotions surrounding this malfunction.
